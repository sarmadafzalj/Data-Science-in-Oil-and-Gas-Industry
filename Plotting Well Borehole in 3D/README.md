# Plotting Oil and Gas Well Borehole in 3D â€” Python

![Well Borehole in 3D](images/gif.gif)

## Introduction
In this repository, you will find Python code to plot oil and gas well borehole profiles in 3D using Plotly. This method is useful for visualizing borehole profiles, which are essential in the oil and gas industry for estimating cement volume for cementing jobs, avoiding casing failures, and ensuring efficient production from formations.

## Dependencies
To run the code in this repository, you will need the following Python packages:
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Plotly

## Usage
You can use the notebook which has step by step detail.

## Methodology
- Import Packages: Import necessary Python packages including Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, and Plotly.
- Read Data: Read the dataset from a CSV file into a Pandas DataFrame.
- Prepare Data: Compute theta, z, and radius values for plotting the well borehole profile in 3D.
- Create Meshgrid: Use NumPy meshgrid to create a grid of coordinates for the cylindrical surface.
- Convert to Cartesian Coordinates: Convert polar coordinates to Cartesian coordinates (x, y, z).
- Plot 3D Borehole Profile: Create a Plotly 3D figure and add the well borehole profile data to it.
- Styling: Set the title, axis labels, aspect ratio, and size of the plot.
