# Learn How to Shade and Plot Wireline Caliper Log in Matplotlib Python

![Well Wireline Logs](images/washout.png)

## Introduction
In this repository, you will find Python code to plot oil and gas well borehole profile with Caliper data for actual diameter against bit size and color the washouts and under-gauge areas.

In a borehole, the diameter often deviates from the intended size created by the drilling bit. This is due to the presence of loose formations that erode, altering the wellâ€™s shape at various depths, a phenomenon known as washout. Additionally, certain formations, like shale, can swell, resulting in an undergauge well profile in these areas.

## Dependencies
To run the code in this repository, you will need the following Python packages:
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib

## Usage
You can use the notebook which has step by step detail.
