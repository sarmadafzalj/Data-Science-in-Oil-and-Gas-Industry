# Composite Petrophysical Well Log Plotting in Python

## Overview
This Python script demonstrates how to plot a composite wireline petrophysical log using Matplotlib. The script focuses on visualizing three tracks of data: Borehole, Resistivity, and Neutron Density logs.

## Importance of Petrophysical Well Logs
Petrophysical well logs are crucial for understanding subsurface formations and identifying hydrocarbon zones. These logs, recorded using tools in the wellbore, provide valuable insights into formation characteristics.

## Data Source
The script utilizes well log data downloaded from KGS Magellan Logs, converted from LAS to CSV format.
